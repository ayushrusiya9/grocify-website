# Grocify Website 

**Simple Grocery Web App built with React + JSON Server** — demo grocery store with basic CRUD operations and login/signup using local storage for demo data.

## Demo
Live here: https://grocify-ebon.vercel.app

## What This Project Does
This project is a **front-end grocery app** where users can:
-  Browse grocery items
-  Add new items (CRUD via JSON Server)
-  Edit or delete existing items
-  Login & Signup (local storage demo — not secure for production)

It’s a **learning & showcase project**, helping you understand:
✔ React state & props  
✔ JSON Server for mock backend  
✔ CRUD operations  
✔ Routing & form handling  
✔ Local storage for saving auth demo

## Why It Matters
This is not just a static UI — it shows you how a real web app manages data, interacts with a server (mock), and handles user flows like login and item management.

Perfect for:
✔ Beginners in React  
✔ Portfolio piece  
✔ Practice with frontend + backend mock

## Tech Stack
